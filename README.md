# mean-stack-todo-list
A to-do list web application implemented on a MEAN stack.

## Notes
- This was my first time creating a MEAN stack application from scratch
- A user can register and login to the application, then add and delete items from their to-do list
- See the app-pictures folder for screenshots of the application
